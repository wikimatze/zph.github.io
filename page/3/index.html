  <div class="entry-content"><h2>GTD FTW!</h2>

<p>Why am I engaging in this hipster habit of using Covey&#8217;s &#8216;Getting Things Done&#8217; methodology?  <em>Because</em> there&#8217;s something very valuable to it!</p>

<p>The analogies that Stephen Covey uses in his book hit home for geeks.  He describes the working memory we humans possess as Random Access Memory, which requires energy to sustain it.  Furthermore, he reminds the reader that if the RAM is busy, other thoughts can&#8217;t percolate through that stage of consciousness?</p>

<h3>Sound too esoteric?</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s get down to <em>bare metal</em>. Or <em>brass tacks</em>. Or any other colloquialism that suits.</p>

<p>Throughout the day I have ideas.  Many of them are good ideas :).  Many of these good ideas percolate to the surface at inopportune moments&#8230; like meetings, reviewing reports, or writing code.  These ideas are <em>GREAT</em> but what&#8217;s their value if they disappear before I can act on them?</p>

<p>Nothing.  That&#8217;s how much value these ideas have if they flit right back out of my consciousness.  Might not be a big deal if it&#8217;s remembering a food item to pick-up on the way home.  Might be a <em>huge deal</em> if it&#8217;s a programming or business idea that could be implemented and turned into a product!</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s the solution?</h4>

<p>I mentioned using ThinkingRock GTD system in this <a href="http://www.xargs.io/2013/02/getting-thinking-rock-v2-1-work-on-osx-10-8/">post</a>.  ThinkingRock v2.1 is an open-source project hosted on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/thinkingrock/files/ThinkingRock/TR%202.2.1/"> SourceForge </a>.</p>

<p>ThinkingRock does the usual stuff that one would expect from a GTD program:
* Collect Thoughts in an Inbox
* Processing
* Organization
* Reviewing
* Action</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the killer feature of this app for my workflow?</p>

<h3>That ideas can be dumped into it using the universal communication currency of our age, <em>EMAIL</em>!</h3>

<p>My goal is to reduce the friction in the GTD system so that I waste as little energy as possible on the process itself.</p>

<p>Email input is a very powerful feature.  I&#8217;ve setup a dedicated email account for receiving GTD tasks and then configured ThinkingRock to import tasks from there every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The next step in this process was writing a short commandline script that is prefilled with the GTD email address.  The script combines all commandline input less the scriptname itself and uses that value as the subject line of the email.  This makes for an incredibly fluid system of GTD task entry.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the simple Ruby script for this task (note that auth info is placed in <code>~/.gmailrc</code>):
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/5001831.js"></script></p>

<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more!  If you keep reading this blog post, you&#8217;ll receive more time saving advice at no additional cost.  That&#8217;s &#8220;#{SOME<em>MADE</em>UP_VALUE}&#8221;!</p>

<p>Back to the point, I integrated this script into Alfred.app.  Now the tasks can be entered directly from Alfred!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far with getting back into the GTD methodology&#8230; but I&#8217;m excited!  Having better programming chops this time when approaching GTD is certainly improving the process :).</p>

<h4>Still to come:</h4>

<p>I discussed in this <a href="http://www.xargs.io/2013/02/getting-thinking-rock-v2-1-work-on-osx-10-8/">post</a> that I wanted to use the open-source version rather than the newer closed source version because of having the ability to dig into the code.  In an upcoming post I&#8217;ll discuss how the open-source program allowed me to investigate the data structure used for ThinkingRock in a way that would be much more challenging if I lacked access to the project source-code!</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments or on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/_ZPH">@_ZPH</a>) if you have ideas on how to improve the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using the daylights out of <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry">Pry</a> ever since learning about it ~ 1 year ago.  I&#8217;ve also been evangelizing about it to anyone who will listen:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/_zph">_zph</a> Thanks for reading!And thanks for teaching me tmux and pry.Been trying them here and there - still very shaky with tmux.</p>&mdash; Steve Jackson (@stevejxsn) <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejxsn/status/302758800069365761">February 16, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The most recent way that I&#8217;m using Pry is by dropping the following line into anywhere that I need to work with:
<code>require 'pry'; binding.pry</code></p>

<p>But adding that to scripts and then deleting it becomes repetitive.  So here&#8217;s a little Vim function that that toggles my Pry statement.  If the current line matches the Pry snipped, the line&#8217;s deleted.  If the current line doesn&#8217;t match the snippet, then the snippet is added at the cursor.  ( It&#8217;s best used on a blank line until I make the function more robust. )</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/4980163.js"></script>

<p>Special thanks go to <a href="http://twitter.com/banisterfiend">@Banisterfiend</a> for all his hard work on the Pry gem.  It makes my Ruby life a much happier experience.  If you&#8217;ve benefited from his hard work, please consider a donation @ the following <a href="http://pryrepl.org/"> link </a>.</p>

<p>Also, special thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter/tpope">Tim Pope</a>.  Reading his vim-fugitive code gave me the syntax hint on how to make this work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found the delightful &#8217;<a href="http://markedapp.com/"> Marked.app </a>&#8217; for OSX recently.  It takes any Markdown file and parses it using a few standard Markdown interpreters, displaying a live view of the text as html.</p>

<p>Of course I wanted to use it everywhere.  And by everywhere, I mean in Vim.  And by that I mean <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeg2">@JEG2</a> posted the idea on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Open an Emacs file in Marked.app:<a href="https://t.co/2JBfev25" title="https://github.com/JEG2/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/packages.el#L121">github.com/JEG2/dotfiles/…</a></p>&mdash; James Edward Gray II (@JEG2) <a href="https://twitter.com/JEG2/status/294607873370120192">January 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And I ported it into a couple of lines in my .vimrc:</p>

  <div class="entry-content">So, PRODUCTIVITY, GTD, BUZZWORDS HERE.

I&#8217;ve used ThinkingRock before when on a GTD kick a few years back. I liked how strictly it followed GTD. I liked being able to email myself thoughts to act on later, since email is the universal currency. I liked the tickle feature.

I&#8217;m certainly willing to pay for software, as evidenced even by my donations to VIM, but I like the flexibility that&#8217;s available with open source software.

The older version, v2.1, of ThinkingRock is available on SourceForge along with the source files. Given that I know zero Java, I thought it would be fun to have the source available for any program that I&#8217;m regularly using.

So that leaves me with installing v2.1 on OSX 10.8 rather than the newer version. Unfortunately, while the newer version installs quite nicely and opens as you&#8217;d expect, v2.1 throws an error : unable to locate jdkhome, use &#8211;jdkhome switch.

I Googled around and found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6614380/jdk-on-osx-10-7-lion"> explanation of the JDK location </a> and combined it with this <a href="http://www.microchip.com/forums/m668597.aspx">explanation</a> in order to come up with the following solution: hard code the <code>bin/tr</code> shell script to include the appropriate jdkhome location.

Here&#8217;s the modified file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/4975686.js"></script>

Note that line 21 is the modified line.

Now on to revive my 3 year old GTD files, do some major deleting, get email dumps setup, and Get Things Done.

<p>Typing your leader key (mapped to &#8221; by default but remapped to &#8216;,&#8217; by you, right? ) and hitting &#8216;rr&#8217; in quick sequence will execute the current file using your Ruby interpreter.  If you&#8217;re using RVM to manage your Rubies, you might also want to consider adding the vim-rvm extension to use the &#8216;correct&#8217; Ruby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the pleasure of talking today via Twitter and Skype with Wes Garrison, Founder of <a href="http://databasically.com/">Databasically</a>, one of the organizers of <a href="http://www.rubymidwest.com/">Ruby Midwest</a> and all around nice guy. We met back at SteelCityRubyConf during the CodeRetreat and have been in intermittent Twitter contact since.</p>

<p>We talked about a project that I&#8217;m finalizing in order to pitch to my company.  His feedback on the app, especially in pointing me directly to a solution for highlighting, reminded me that I need to spend more time with experienced developers.  In those few minutes he pointed me to the tools that increased the value and utility of my product.  Within minutes of getting off of Skype, I added the highlighting feature, tweaked the CSS, and a bit of the underlying Ruby.  It&#8217;s a big improvement :).</p>

<p>After the Skype conversation ended, the conversation continued on Twitter with Wes pointing out that I should consider using the Decorator pattern in my Rails application.  I remembered seeing Draper on Github and an hour later I had a working implementation that abstracted away some complexity from my views.  Yet another point related to him having more experience than I.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reminded how much easier it is to learn from people who have already walked a certain path and distilled the necessary knowledge, rather than re-inventing the wheel yourself.  This isn&#8217;t to say that developers should rely on others for all their answers, but I&#8217;ve been 100% self sufficient with my trusty Google-based answers thus far.  It&#8217;s time for me to better network and share knowledge.</p>

<p>To this end, I need to make time for remote pair programming.  I met <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joelbyler">@JoelByler</a> of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leandog">LeanDog</a> at a CodeRetreat in Cleveland earlier this year.  We discussed remote pair programming for fun, but with household responsibilities, preparing a product to pitch, and longer than normal work hours it&#8217;s been tough to schedule.</p>

<p>But tough to schedule is no excuse.  I&#8217;m getting more diligent about reducing my time consuming blog posts and external information and making a dedicated goal of increasing my productivity.  Not hoaky productivity like you see blogged about on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">Lifehacker.com</a> where you read about a million ways to improve productivity while accomplishing nothing in life.  I&#8217;m talking serious productivity of cutting out unnecessary fluff time, idle web browsing, and conserving effort for producing things.  Some of my current goals in this regard are another couple of web applications related to my industry, a series of webcasts, building a newsletter list of people interested in the theme of the screencasts and providing that set of readers with tailored articles.  I&#8217;ll have a much easier time of this if my employer sees the value in the product I created and transitions me into a development role.  That way the web apps can be developed during work time :) where they will also be consumed by my fellow teammates.</p>

<p>In closing, I&#8217;m working on things that I can control and appreciating good advice when I get it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reading this in the Kansas City area and need help with tech stuff, Wes Garrison @ <a href="http://databasically.com/">Databasically</a> will solve your problems. Give him a ring.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the Cleveland area or just want a good group of people to work with for your Rails application, get a hold of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leandog">LeanDog</a>.  Joel Byler, Steve Jackson and the rest of the crew are a good group of folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a great talk by Scott Hanselman on Vimeo about information overload and learning to ignore things. In the <a href="https://vimeo.com/39020426">video</a> he laments that more conversation is taking place in walled gardens (ie Twitter) rather than on the wide open web (ie blogs).  He also summarizes what I&#8217;ve felt for a few months: * that keeping up with news and the latest things is reducing my ability to produce and innovate *.</p>

<p>It comes back to the concepts in this article: <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/500-words-before-8am">500 Words before 8am</a>.  Start the day as a producer, not a consumer.</p>

<p>In order to work on this, I&#8217;ve set myself up with <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a> and am tracking the amount of time spent on &#8216;consumptive tasks&#8217; (no relation to romantic portrayals of consumption by Val Kilmer in &#8216;Tombstone&#8217;).  I&#8217;m receiving pop-up warnings when I exceed a set quantity of time on reading Twitter, reading blogs, etc.  I&#8217;m also looking to transition more of my consumption time to &#8216;curated content&#8217; such as &#8216;ye old books&#8217;.</p>

<p>Another point that I took to heart from Scott Hanselman&#8217;s talk was about learning to use <a href="www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.  It&#8217;s an SF startup that makes common web tasks automatic.  Think of it as a recurrent cron job for the web.  Things like : &#8216;anytime I start a tweet, add the contained links to instapaper&#8217;, or &#8216;anytime I start a vimeo video, post it to twitter&#8217;.  One filter that I added to help with the Ruby Rogues Parley list is &#8216;anytime I star a gmail message, copy the content into Evernote&#8217;&#8230; this should help easily archive good content for later viewing and recall :).</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s it for this round of production.  I spent much of last night working on an internal web application for work that I plan to soon pitch to my company :).  I finished the final polish on it (CSS, a little Javascript) and I must say that it feels 100% better.  It&#8217;s a good reminder for me about how important the UI is for applications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s talk about how to use the shell.  It&#8217;s a dirty secret that many of the repetitive commands used in the day-to-day world of developers are rudimentary shell commands.</p>

<p>Think of the activity of making a new folder and moving into that folder to start writing code, it looks something like this: <code>mkdir new_project; cd new_project; vim new_project_code_file.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Tighten it up and pay attention to simple improvements in the shell environment.  ( My experiences are with BASH and ZSH ).  That command becomes the following command with a little bit of improved shell configs: <code>mkdircd new_project (makes dir and cds in the same command); e !!1_code_file.rb</code>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s in this shorter series of commands?  Let&#8217;s break it down to parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mkdir</code> and <code>cd</code> are replaced by a single new command <code>mkdircd</code>.  We save the repetition of typing the folder name twice by compressing the command into a single request.  It&#8217;s accomplished by setting up an alias in the shell configs.</li>
<li><code>vim new_project_code_file.rb</code> is replaced with <code>e !!1_code_file.rb</code>. The <code>e</code> command is another shell tweak of mine.  <code>e</code> is a shell function that steps in for the vim command and opens files for editing in a more intelligent way.  See the source here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/0aec0ef19fce9bbd3e3d">e</a> (Note that it also depends upon the wonderful FASD utility available on Github.com).</li>
<li><code>!!1</code> becomes the first argument from the prior line, i.e. the first item after the command itself.  Using !!1, !!2, !!3 has saved me countless seconds of retyping the same long folder/file names.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, make the shell work for you!  If you&#8217;re spending time in a new envionrment like the Linux Terminal or OSX&#8217;s Terminal, learn to configure that BASH or ZSH environment.</p>

<p>It will pay off nicely!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">I saw a post this afternoon by a member of Ruby Rogue&#8217;s Parley list asking how to write Ruby code to help them create a shorthand word for a longer commandline command.  It takes moxy to ask questions on a list filled with many experienced developers.  I was happy to see that positive responses flowed in.

The immediate response was that the individual should perform the action by writing commandline aliases using the shell &#8216;alias&#8217; command. But that only points the developer in the right direction. Instead of just pointing in the direction, the rest of this post will be walking a new developer through setting up helpful customizations in the shell environment.

(Note, the generic information will be fairly compatible whether using the BASH environment or ZShell environment. Moving past general configurations into advanced configurations are where the two start to diverge, particularly with the environmental settings used in .bashrc or .zshrc files. I&#8217;ve found that the best remedy for this is reading through and gradually adopting a few lines here and there from well commented .bashrc/.zshrc files).

Many of the customizations in the shell relate to minimizing repetitive keystrokes. Imagine the difference between typing [cc_bash]bundle exec rails server[/cc_bash] and [cc_bash]be r s[/cc_bash]. If you&#8217;re typing this more than occasionally, it&#8217;s a large savings of keystrokes over a period of months. So how is it done? <em>* Aliases *</em>!

Simply put, include the following code in your config file (a generic term that I&#8217;ll use for either .bashrc or .zshrc, depending on your shell):
[cc_bash]alias j=&#8221;jobs&#8221;[/cc_bash]

Or to help avoid dumb mistakes (it makes the remove command verbose and interactive =D. Even astute geeks fat finger the occasional keys )
[cc_bash]alias rm=&#8221;rm -iv&#8221;[/cc_bash]

I&#8217;ve taken to heart the adage, which I can&#8217;t attribute precisely, that anything typed more than a couple times on the commandline should be shortened to save future keystrokes. To prove this point, I currently have greater than <em>* 100 *</em> aliases and growing.  Note that the following is from dumping all of my aliases to STDOUT via [cc_bash]alias > jist -p -c[/cc_bash] and is not representative of one of my alias files.  (For that, see the second inset codeblock).
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/zph/4958386.js"></script>

Here&#8217;s an example of one of my alias files&#8230; appropriately called &#8216;aliases.conf.zsh&#8217;:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/4965016.js"></script>
(Original code is at: https://github.com/zph/zph/blob/master/home/.zsh.d/aliases.conf.zsh)

So that&#8217;s &#8216;aliases&#8217;. I find that they&#8217;re easier to keep organized if I setup a dedicated &#8216;.zsh.d&#8217; folder. By which I mean that I created a folder called &#8216;.zsh.d&#8217; in the base of my home directory with the following layout:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/zph/1f94ccb11a59eee9ffb0.js"></script>
This folder contains all of the &#8216;zsh&#8217; configuration files on my system other than &#8216;.zshrc&#8217;.  Each general category of config files gets its own file, ie git.zsh, ruby.zsh, homebrew.zsh, etc.  Helps me keep everything organized =D.

I set the following lines in my &#8216;~/.zshrc&#8217; to source each file within the &#8216;.zsh.d&#8217; directory that has the extension of &#8216;.zsh&#8217;
[cc_bash]
_source_zshd(){
# Finally, source all the files in zsh.d (ALPHA order)
for zshd in $(find ~/.zsh.d/*.zsh | sort ); do
source &#8220;${zshd}&#8221;
done
}
_source_zshd
[/cc_bash]

This isn&#8217;t necessary, but it helps me keep the individual configurations nicely ordered.

To recap, use aliases. Use the daylights out of them. Make your shell a finely honed tool that&#8217;s nicely crafted to your needs. Oh yeah&#8230; do the same with &#8216;functions&#8217; which I can cover in a future blog post.  And look into <a href="https://github.com/clvv/fasd" title="FASD">FASD</a> because it&#8217;s awesome like Narwhals!

<time datetime="2012-12-29T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 29<span>th</span>, 2012</time> -

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Trello-Archiver is a set of Ruby scripts that allows one to export their Trello board into a CSV, TSV, or XLSX file. It was started by another person on Github.com named Mad_Typist. Early on in the process I sent them a pull request to contribute my changes back&#8230; but they don&#8217;t seem to be around. Given that, I&#8217;ve forked the project and continued to develop it for my own benefit.</p>

<p>Trello-Archiver relies on a few conventions that exist in the Ruby world. 1. Project dependencies are managed with <code>Bundler</code> 2. A semi-recent version of Ruby is used <code>&gt;= 1.9.2</code></p>

<p>To use the project on a system that isn&#8217;t setup for Ruby development, the first step is to install a recent version of Ruby. I prefer to use a tool called Ruby Version Manager for this <a href="www.rvm.io">RVM</a>.</p>

<p>Install a sane Ruby Version Manager along with Recent Ruby
<code>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</code></p>

<p>Source the installed script to allow for using RVM this first time w/ this command: 
<code>source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></p>

<p>Future logins will automatically source RVM using your bashrc or zshrc.</p>

<p>The next step is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/zph/trello-archiver.git"> Trello-Archiver </a> repo from Github.</p>

<p>Then <code>cd trello-archiver</code> and run <code>bundle install</code>. Bundler installs the necessary dependencies for <strong>Trello-Archiver</strong>. The nice feature about Bundler is that it manages individual projects&#8217; dependencies independently :).</p>

<p>Next, <code>cp config.example.yml config.yml</code>. Config.example.yml is the template for where the authentication credentials are stored along with any default settings.</p>

<p>Open up <code>config.yml</code> with your favorite text editor. Instructions are inclosed in there for how to gather your secret credentials from Trello.com.</p>

<p>First, open <code>https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate</code> in your web browser. Copy the first key as your &#8216;public key&#8217; and the second (longer) key as your &#8216;private_key&#8217;.</p>

<p>Next we need to enter those values into a special url: <code>https://trello.com/1/connect?key=PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_ABOVE&amp;name=ANYNAME&amp;response_type=token&amp;scope=read,account&amp;expiration=never</code> The two values that need replacing in this URL are PUBLIC<em>KEY</em>FROM_ABOVE nd ANYNAME. ANYNAME is a placeholder for any text that you want to use to identify this key, ie it could be TrelloArchiver. Also note that this is authorizing Read-Only access. This way, even if there&#8217;s a bug in the software the token won&#8217;t allow changes to your Trello information.</p>

<p>Past that value into your web browser and click allow on the confirmation webpage.</p>

<p>The following page that loads has your &#8216;access<em>token</em>key&#8217;. Copy this value into your <code>config.yml</code>. Save <code>config.yml</code> and exit to commandline.</p>

<p><em>That&#8217;s it for authentication setup</em>! Make sure to be careful with this config.yml and don&#8217;t go adding it to any public git repos ;).</p>

<p>Now for backing things up :). Decide if you want a specific board backed up or all of them.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s backup a single board: -<code>ruby bin/trello_backup.rb</code> -Choose your board by number and hit enter -Enter a filename or not (it defaults to name of board and date stamp) -Defaults to exporting as XLSX (this is easily changed in script).</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s backup all the boards: -<code>ruby bin/trello-autoarchive.rb</code> -Sit back and wait for it to finish! -It&#8217;s set to backup all boards with default names and using XLSX filetype.</p>

<p>Caveats: It saves these files into the current folder. Apparently I broke CSV functionality with some recent changes. I&#8217;ll get it working again. The spreadsheet structure is what works for me. If you need a different configuration, please let me know and I&#8217;ll look into it. Not all info is backed up. For full backup, download your JSON export from Trello. The main thing that I didn&#8217;t include in Trello-Archiver is a set of timestamps for when a Card is moved to each List. This could be a future feature if others have a need for it.</p>
