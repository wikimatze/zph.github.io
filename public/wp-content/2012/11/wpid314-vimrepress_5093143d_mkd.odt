Migrating from a flaky VPS to a more reliable one has generally been a hassle.
But one easy part was migrating NeoRouter Server to a new Xen VPS.

[cc_bash]
Tar and compress /usr/local/ZebraNetworks/NeoRouter
Rsync or scp that file over to new VPS
wget NeoRouter Server deb file and install via dpkg -i
Decompress file into place in /usr/local... etc
Log into NeoRouter dashboard and redirect domain to new IP address
Save dashboard settings, click 'Domain Status' tab, and gloat in your success![/cc_bash]
