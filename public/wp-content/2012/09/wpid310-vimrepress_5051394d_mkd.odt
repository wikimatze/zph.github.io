I'll keep it short and sweet but here's the top list of tools that I'm using in various tech areas of my life.

  - [FASD](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) - Making me more of a speed daemon on cd'ing around terminal along with instant vimming from anywhere. PEW PEW!

  - [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - Speed daemon in graphical environment with starting new programs, running terminal commands, etc.  Akin to Launchy, Gnome-Do, Quicksilver (which I wish worked better on my Mac). [ This one is Mac specific but see other programs for different OSes ]

  - [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) - Customizable and nicely integrates with tmux. [Mac specific, but on Linux I've been super happy with Terminator ]

  - [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) - Terminal multiplexer.  Like screen, but much more easily customized.  Feels like a VIM take on screen control once it's tweaked.

  - [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) - My favorite editor.  Mainly used in the terminal but occasionally I use MacVim for the glitz.

  - [Vimium](http://vimium.github.com/) - Bring the powers of VIM into the Chrome Browser.  Very very slick interface, especially for opening links, scrolling ... just go install it.

  - [VimRepress](https://bitbucket.org/pentie/vimrepress) - Blog with Wordpress from the safety confines of VIM (as I am now)... in MARKDOWN!

  - [GoogleCl](http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/) - Commandline access to Google features such as Contacts and Calendars.  Great for adding events from the commandline.  Python tool IIRC.

  - [QuickCursor](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor) - Lets me use VIM to edit just about anything.  It opens a new VIM instance/buffer with the highlighted text, say from an email and pushes it back into that spot after editing w/ Vim.

  - [BetterTouchTool](http://blog.boastr.net/) - Nice easy way to assign keystrokes to open a program, move window to specific region of screen, etc.  Also complemented by BetterSnapTool.

  - [TaskWarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior) - Task manager on the commandline.  Like Todo.sh but with more commandline power and no Android/iOS app.  Worthwhile trade at the moment after 3 weeks use.  Does have a Sinatra app with TaskWarrior integration... and I'm tempted to scrape together a Ruby tool to have commandline Pomodoro tracker that integrates with Growl and TaskWarrior (as an annotate function)

  And in no specific order:

  -Dropbox, Evernote, DashExpander, Pomodairo, TweetDeck, Sparrow/Thunderbird (Sparrow for slick integration, Thunderbird for extensions and power), and last but certainly not least Z-Shell.


  Let me know in the comments or on Twitter if I'm missing any good tools!
