Very handy for quickly swapping between prior file and current file in VIM:

Add the following to VIMRC:
[cc_vim]nnoremap <Leader>, :b#<CR>[/cc_vim]

My current leader key is set to comma (,) so punching ,, switches between prior and current file, or back again.

Runner up for other good one liners:
[cc_vim]inoremap jk <ESC>[/cc_vim] 
This one allows you to stay on the commandline and ESCAPE out of insert mode by using key combo 'jk'!

PS - The only conflict I've had with j k being an ESC sequence is this blog post.  In code and prose I haven't run into problems.
