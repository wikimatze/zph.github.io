<p>I switched to a Macbook Air a few months ago and I've been generally quite happy with the setup.</p>
<p>One thing I'm unhappy with is the availability of my two favorite calculator programs.  On Linux distos I'm accustomed to installing 'qalculate' and on Windows it's been GraphCalc.  I tried to find equivalent programs under OSX, giving it all of 15 min of effort, but couldn't find a robust solution with good history, nice data entry, etc.</p>
<p>So, I decided to stick with my favorite ('Qalculate').  I then tried installing it from source under OSX which didn't succeed.  I then tried to do the same with graphcalc's Linux source, with the same result.</p>
<p>At this point I remembered toying around with X-forwarding over SSH.  Since I had already installed the X11 environment for running GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), it was trivial to que up a virtual instance of Debian Linux under Parallels.  I installed Qalculate in that virtual instance and used the ssh command for X-forwarding:
[cc_bash]ssh -X username@server_name 'qalculate-gtk &amp;'[/cc_bash]</p>
<p>The result is that I have a virtual instance of Debian running in the background, my normal OSX interface, and my favorite calculate ready to go (as if it were a native OSX application).</p>
<p>Thanks SSH!</p><!-- #VIMREPRESS_TAG# http://198.211.104.146/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/vimrepress_5008c862_mkd.odt vimrepress_5008c862_mkd.odt -->
