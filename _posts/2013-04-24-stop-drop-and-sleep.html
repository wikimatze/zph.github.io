Exhaustion has become the norm.

Take my own evening last night as an example. We had a long day at work and I was spent by the time I arrived home. After running a necessary errand, the hour had pushed towards 9PM, which meant dinner was going to be a cursory affair.

You, my gentle reader, might expect me to crash into an uninterupted slumber at this point in the story. Unfortunately, I didn't.

I spent the next ~ 3 hours reading tech news, catching up with friends on Twitter, and staring semi-comatose at my laptop monitor. I tried to work on learning new programming techniques, but it wasn't sinking in, nor did I have the requisite motivation. I collapsed into bed sometime after midnight and woke feeling groggy and spent.

I've been reflecting on the <em>WHY</em> of this behavior and it's the motivation for this blog post.
<h1><em>WHY</em></h1>
I spend a fair bit of effort in life considering my actions and the outcomes involved. I try to play these in the right manner to "Optimize for Happiness(TM)" as <a href="http://twitter.com/erniemiller">@erniemiller</a> so eloquently stated at RubyMidwest 2013.

But I didn't follow through on the logical process last night because in addition to needing rest, I also needed to decompress and stimulate my mind.

I'm going to go out on a limb here: I think that my reluctance to fall asleep is endemic of our social expectations in a slice of American society.
<h1>Work Longer, Faster, Smarter</h1>
Living in a culture that idolizes workaholics demands a special response from those of us who yearn to maintain a work-life balance. Especially when prone to hard work and long hours, stepping back and turning off can be a challenging habit to cultivate.

I'm not sure what the right response is when we have competing pressures in life, beyond making the best decisions available given the resources at that moment. And with each decision, reflect on the behavior and outcome to determine if it should be repeated.
