    \ It can also turn into a nightmare without the right preparation.\r\n\r\n## Travel
    Tips\r\n\r\n* Bring currency (US / UK / Euro) in decent quantities in small bills
    ($500+). This is emergency money for towns without ATMs.\r\n* Carry that currency
    distributed among various hiding places on your person and in your luggage. Consider
    getting extra hidden pockets sewn into some of your pants.\r\n* Wear easily washed
    clothing. Quick dry fabric is very convenient when forced to wash clothing in
    a hostel's sink.\r\n* Bring all purpose liquid soap. I'm talking about hippie
    soap here like 'Dr. Bronner's'. It can be used for washing your body, your hair,
    and your clothing.\r\n* Keep only enough currency for a day or two in your wallet
    or purse. If someone pickpockets you, you've lost very little and have a story
    to tell.\r\n* Be skeptical of people who approach you. Some are great awesome
    people, others are hustlers. Learn the difference.\r\n* Be more trusting when
    you approach people. I made a habit of choosing my taxi drivers rather than choosing
    the ones who were overly interested in me.\r\n* Avoid the heavily touristed areas
    and densely populated areas. Pickpockets and scams will be more prevalent where
    a higher density of marks exists.\r\n* Withdraw currency from ATMs in well lit
    areas.\r\n* Use ATMs instead of currency exchangers.  You'll tend to get better
    rates.\r\n* Bring a good little flashlight and headlamp, especially when visiting
    areas without much infrastructure.\r\n* Shoot plenty of photos, especially of
    people and local vibrancy. Landscape photos won't have the same staying power.\r\n*
    Write a journal or blog while traveling to share your experiences with those back
    home.\r\n* Contact your banks and credit card companies before leaving. Let them
    know the locations of your visit and the duration. This minimizes the risk that
    the cards will trigger fraud alerts while traveling.\r\n* Leave a photocopy of
    passport, credit cards and any other travel paperwork with a trusted friend or
    family member. Keep a second photocopy set in your luggage.\r\n* If you want or
    need connectivity while away, bring a GSM unlocked phone.  In the US, a phone
    from AT&T that's unlocked would be a decent choice.\r\n* Learn basic internet
    safety and use a VPN or SSH Tunnel for routing your data when on unknown internet
    connections. Better safe than hacked.\r\n* Consider using 2 Factor Authentication
    if you must use an Internet Cafe to log into your email. Even with this protection,
    try to avoid it.\r\n\r\nWhat other travel tips have you used to make foreign travel
    a smoother process?\r\n\r\nIf you want to engage in [ Extreme Retirement Planning
    \ ](http://www.civet.ws/2013/05/hack-your-finances-thoughts-on-extreme-retirement-planning/),
    living abroad on $600 - $1000 / mo and retiring early wouldn't be too horrible
    ;) Especially with a remote job!"
