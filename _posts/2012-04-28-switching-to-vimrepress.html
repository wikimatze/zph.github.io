I've been looking for a way to lower the friction involved in blogging. Since I'm spending much of my free time on the commandline, I looked for a VIM solution.
The plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimRepress.git">VimRepress</a> and it allows you to revise, edit and post blog postings in VIM!
The installation process was simple using 'pathogen': just a git clone of the repository into my ~/.vim/bundle, install the python-markdown module, and add a few configuration &amp; authorization lines to my ~/.vimrc.</p>
Add the following to your ~/.vimrc
[cc_vim]let g:vimrepress_tags_completable = 'true'
let VIMPRESS=[{'username':'BLOG_USER', 'password':'SECRET', 'blog_url':'http://www.civet.ws/'}]     [/cc]
Now open up VIM and the blog commands start with :Blog[List, New, etc].
