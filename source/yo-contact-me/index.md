I'm *VERY* happily employed full time but I'll consider the right side projects if I have availability and we're a good fit. I often schedule freelancing work one to two months in advance.

## Full-time work

I work remotely and prefer limited travel (in the range of monthly to quarterly). I'm not looking for opportunities since I have a good fit in my current role (and other offers waiting in the wings from friends), but if you have something exceptional where I can work on hard problems and pair program with talented and empathetic individuals, email me.

## Freelancing

Read [About Me]("http://www.xargs.io/me/") and jot a note in an [email]('mailto:zander@xargs.io') about the project details. I'm interested to hear about your project :) and I look forward to setting up a video call to discuss it further.

I'm currently interested in working on projects that involve web scraping, functional programming, or commandline tools written in Golang.
