I'm *VERY* happily employed full time but I'll consider the right side projects if I have availability and we're a good fit. I often schedule freelancing work one to two months in advance.

Read [About Me]("http://www.xargs.io/me/") and jot a note in an [email]('mailto:zander@xargs.io') about the project details. I'm interested to hear about your project :) and I look forward to setting up a video call to discuss it further.
