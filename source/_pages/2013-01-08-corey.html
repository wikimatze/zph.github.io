<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hi Corey!</h1>
<a href="http://www.civet.ws/me/googleplus_icon/" rel="attachment wp-att-366"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-366" alt="googleplus_icon" src="http://198.211.104.146/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/googleplus_icon-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>

^ This is me! Wait no, I haven't been an icon for some years now.

Rather, it's the icon I use for myself on social media websites!
<h3><strong>Let's Try this Introduction again:</strong></h3>
I'm Zander (<a title="Twitter" href="http://www.twitter/_zph">@_ZPH</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zph?tab=activity">Github</a>). We met and talked for a few minutes at Steel City Ruby 2012. You were affable and inclusive and I had the pleasure of sitting with you and Josh Susser at the Irish bar.  That conference was the first time I'd ever met anyone in person who programmed Ruby!  It was a wonderful experience.

<strong>Now for something completely different:</strong>

&nbsp;
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>I want you to be my Ruby mentor!</strong></em></h1>
&nbsp;

<h3>How could this possibly work?</h3>
I can offer assistance, perhaps in simpler programming tasks, or if I get up to speed on editing screencasts, I can lend assistance with editing your screencasts, thereby freeing you to do more creation (I purchased Screenflow for my own screencasting project).  I'm capable and professional; let's talk about what I can do for you.

I see it as an experience to sweep the floors and wax them while learning about the Way of the Code. You can call me Daniel-San if it helps.  I promise not to call you Mr. Miyagi unless you're down with it.

In return, I want to get involved and by doing so, acquire some guidance in programming, better programming patterns, and just get elbow deep in better code than my own.
<h3>Is this a covert action to pester you for a job?</h3>
No. I'm happily employed full time, but I'm serious and excited about Ruby. I have plenty of responsibilities in life, including my work, my partner, my kittens, our house renovation, my aging parents, etc.

But I'm really passionate about programming so I'll find at least a few hours a week that can be dedicated to my apprenticeship.
<h3>Am I going to try to write Ruby using M$ Word and bring you shame?</h3>
Only as a joke.  I spent the last year teaching myself VIM for Ruby coding.  I've taken some of my cues from G. Bernhardt and others from @r00k.  Others are due to long hours in the terminal (iTerm2 to be exact).  Now I add keybindings in other contexts, such as Chrome, to make sure that my VIM keybindings go where I go.

As for a quick outline of tools: I'm very comfortable in Linux/OSX, especially the commandline.  I'm a VIM using, ZSH $SHELL, heavily aliased, dotfile repo'd nerd.  And proud of it!  When doing stuff in Ruby, I love Pry and am falling for Rcodetools for little snippets/demos.  I've done a small amount of TDD but have much to learn.
<h3>What Dreyfus Model Level am I currently at with Ruby? (Beginner, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert)</h3>
Competent.  Perhaps leaning toward the Proficient side but not there yet.
<h3>What have I accomplished with Ruby?</h3>
puts "Hello World"

^ Is that sufficient....

I've been working on Ruby projects largely by myself for the past year.  I'm proud of the following programming accomplishments:
<ul>
	<li>One started as a <strong>web-scraping project</strong> and <strong>commandline</strong> tool that transformed into a task automation framework utilizing <strong>Sinatra, Google Maps, GeoKit, PDFKit,</strong> <strong>Geo-spacial calculations</strong> and a whole lot of learning.</li>
	<li>One started with web-scraping and turned into an internal <strong>Rails</strong> website using <strong>MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and Bootstrap</strong>.</li>
	<li>More recently I've been working on this: <strong><a href="https://github.com/zph/trello-archiver">Trello-Archiver</a></strong>.  Trello is a <strong>Kanban</strong> style webapp that I've talked my office into using instead of Excel (no, I don't work as a programmer at this stage :).  Trello-Archiver is a set of scripts that allows downloading CSV and XLSX formatted data from the Kanban system using Ruby-Trello and ultimately the Trello API.  It has become a handy tool for keeping the traditional spreadsheet formatting while storing data in a <strong>robust timestamped system</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Teaching my father</strong> the basics of <strong>Ruby programming</strong>.  He has zero programming background which is essentially where I stood ~3 years ago.  We worked through the primitive datatypes, OO concepts (Classes, methods, inheritance), and Enumerable methods.  We found ourselves spending 2 hours on Skype each weekend discussing it while he read through the Pickaxe manual.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Moar credentials by virtue of where I source my knowledge</h3>
I subscribe to <strong>DestroyAllSoftware</strong> by G. Bernhardt, <strong>RubyTapas</strong> by Avdi Grimm, <strong>Railscasts</strong> by R. Bates, <strong>RubyParley</strong>, and never miss a <strong>Ruby Rogues</strong> episode.

I've attended each <strong>CodeRetreat</strong> within 3 hours driving distance since learning about them in Sept 2012.
<h3>Ok, ok, so I watch screencasts and go hang with programmers for fun.  What else?</h3>

<h3>Where do I see myself in 1 year?</h3>
Programming professionally.  I'm happily employed in the best field that I've encountered thus far.  I love my co-workers.  I'm financially comfortable.  But the mental challenge of the job is only moderate.  Within 12 months, I want to start using my passion for programming as a primary part of my career.  But I'm happily set until the right opportunity appears :).
<h3>Where do I see myself in 5-10 years?</h3>
Working as a programmer/entrepreneur/businessman (a blend of all three).
<h3>Let's Chat :)</h3>

Think of it as voluntary indentured labor.  We'll find some aspects that I can work on and I'll get started!
