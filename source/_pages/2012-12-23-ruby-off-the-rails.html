<p>Welcome to the landing page for Ruby Off The Rails! 

ROTR, which might not be the best acronym, is a series of screencasts on Ruby and other interesting technologies. 

The first set of episodes will address the issues involved in setting up a Ruby development environment. We'll jog through the steps involved in setting up Ubuntu Linux inside a virtual machine by using VirtualBox. We'll then configure the system to ease into Ruby development. But the best part is the Creative Commons licensed music that accompanies each video as we hustle through topics!
