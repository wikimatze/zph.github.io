  mkd_text: "I attended [RubyMidwest](http://twitter.com/rubymidwest) and want to
    share both my impressions and resulting growth.\r\n\r\nBut let's backup, I had
    debated whether to drive or to fly out to Kansas City, MO for the conference.
    \ With only two weeks to spare, our primary long distance car began having some
    trouble.  So, I looked into the costs of renting a car, the cost of wear and tear
    on our car, vs the possibility of flying.  After tallying up the costs and figuring
    that I could work part of the day while flying, I booked a ticket for Kansas City.
    \ In the future I'll be more eager to travel by air, given that I can successfully
    work from anywhere with WiFi or 4G Coverage.  To a lesser extent, for non-connected
    work, I'm also productive without the internet.\r\n\r\nIf my first successful
    choice was flying, then my second successful choice was when I scheduled my arrival
    and departure.  I flew in the day before the conference and out the day after.
    \ By doing this, I was rested going into the conference and able to socialize
    the night before it started.  Flying out the day after the conference had the
    same effect of enabling more time with the folks that I wanted to see.\r\n\r\nNow
    mind you, I find these concepts fairly un-engaging but they're important for getting
    the most out of the conference experience.\r\n\r\nMy next big win was staying
    at the official conference hotel.  This means that at 4am when you can barely
    see straight from tiredness, your bedroom is only an elevator away. Staying at
    the main hotel also encourages social activity... which is why we're really at
    the conference.  Yes, it's more expensive.  Yes, it might be a tacky venue.  Yes,
    it's not all magically hipster delicious.  If money's an issue, post on Twitter
    that you're looking to split a room.  I had the pleasure of sharing the room with
    [Evan Light](http://twitter.com/elight) because he posted on Twitter about the
    hotel not having vacancies.  Sharing a room's also a great way to make sure you're
    staying in the social mix of the conference rather than scuttling off to a quiet
    place.\r\n\r\n###Twitter is the lifeblood of Ruby Conferences.\r\nAdd a column
    in your Twitter client to track the hashtag designated by the conference.  This
    means you can follow the flow and group activities.  It's also a good place to
    share your enthusiasm for RubyMidwest and ensure that next year has an equally
    awesome crowd.  If you're shy or want help being social, post something like,
    \"Hey come say hi to me, I'm wearing a Yellow Gnu Linux T-Shirt\".  Incidentally,
    that's how I met [Matthias](http://twitter.com/wikimatze) who is writing this
    book about [the Padrino Framework](https://leanpub.com/padrino).\r\n\r\n###Never
    Eat Alone\r\nExcept for coffee when you've just rolled out of bed after 4 hours
    of sleep.  Otherwise, don't eat alone.  This is your magical chance to spend time
    with people as nerdy or nerdier than you.  If you're stumped for conversation,
    ask how they started programming, what their favorite Gems are, what tools they
    use, if they're part of the 20% of programmers who Raided in World of Warcraft
    (then judge them according to whether they rolled Horde or Alliance).\r\n\r\n###Find
    a Small Group\r\nI preferred the time spent in groups of 2-8 people.  This size
    allows for meaningful conversation between the participants.  It's also easier
    for those of us who are slightly hard of hearing.\r\n\r\nEach night of the conference
    had some conversational highlights.\r\n\r\nFriday night's highlights were centered
    around the balcony at the after-party.  [@koribor](http://twitter.com/koribor),
    [@elight](http://twitter.com/elight), [@samullen](http://twitter.com/samullen)
    explained to a fellow not from the conference what it was that programmers do.
    \ By the end of the conversation, the young man was very enthusiastic about learning
    to program.  I volunteered to help him get started and we've been in email contact
    since the conference ended.  This conversation was an impressive display of the
    welcoming attitude that can exist in the Ruby community.\r\n\r\nOn the last night
    of the conference, after the energy had worn off, I had some meaningful and insightful
    conversations.  I'm looking at y'all: [@Bantik](http://twitter.com/bantik),  [@zmoazeni](http://twitter.com/zmoazeni),
    [@aspleenic](http://twitter.com/aspleenic), [@ashedryden](http://twitter.com/ashedryden),
    [@erniemiller](http://twitter.com/erniemiller), [@kerrizor](http://twitter.com/kerrizor),
    [@theOtherZach](http://twitter.com/theotherzach),  ... and more.\r\n\r\n###Initiate
    Conversations\r\nI started many conversations at RubyMidwest simply by walking
    up to people and introducing myself.  The odds are that this will lead into a
    flowing conversation.  If it's stilted and awkward, get the conversation onto
    technical topics... that's the bread and butter of conferences.  Also, people
    at regional Ruby Conferences are remarkably friendly.\r\n\r\n###Company Culture
    Shows Through Employee Behavior\r\nI'm looking at you genial folks from [@Harvest](http://twitter.com/harvest):
    Zach and Paul.\r\n\r\nSending folks who positively represent your company to community
    conferences is a win-win situation.  The devs get to stretch their knowledge and
    have fun.  The company builds a reputation among Ruby's enthusiastic true believers.
    \ Why wouldn't companies want to recruit from this pool of people?\r\n\r\n###What
    Did I Really Learn?\r\nThat I'm attending MadisonRuby, SteelCityRuby and DCamp
    this year.  I'm also excited about stepping up my programming game and getting
    more involved in the community.  These are my people :).\r\n\r\n####Thanks\r\nTo
    Wes Garrison of [Databasically](http://databasically.com/), [Sam Mullen](http://twitter.com/samullen),
    Ross, Cerner, and everyone who made this event possible."

I attended <a href="http://twitter.com/rubymidwest">RubyMidwest</a> and want to share both my impressions and resulting growth.

<h3>Twitter is the lifeblood of Ruby Conferences.</h3>
Add a column in your Twitter client to track the hashtag designated by the conference. This means you can follow the flow and group activities. It's also a good place to share your enthusiasm for RubyMidwest and ensure that next year has an equally awesome crowd. If you're shy or want help being social, post something like, "Hey come say hi to me, I'm wearing a Yellow Gnu Linux T-Shirt". Incidentally, that's how I met <a href="http://twitter.com/wikimatze">Matthias</a> who is writing this book about <a href="https://leanpub.com/padrino">the Padrino Framework</a>.
<h3>Never Eat Alone</h3>
Except for coffee when you've just rolled out of bed after 4 hours of sleep. Otherwise, don't eat alone. This is your magical chance to spend time with people as nerdy or nerdier than you. If you're stumped for conversation, ask how they started programming, what their favorite Gems are, what tools they use, if they're part of the 20% of programmers who Raided in World of Warcraft (then judge them according to whether they rolled Horde or Alliance).

<h3>Initiate Conversations</h3>
I started many conversations at RubyMidwest simply by walking up to people and introducing myself. The odds are that this will lead into a flowing conversation. If it's stilted and awkward, get the conversation onto technical topics... that's the bread and butter of conferences. Also, people at regional Ruby Conferences are remarkably friendly.
<h3>Company Culture Shows Through Employee Behavior</h3>
I'm looking at you genial folks from <a href="http://twitter.com/harvest">@Harvest</a>: Zach and Paul.

Sending folks who positively represent your company to community conferences is a win-win situation. The devs get to stretch their knowledge and have fun. The company builds a reputation among Ruby's enthusiastic true believers. Why wouldn't companies want to recruit from this pool of people?
<h3>What Did I Really Learn?</h3>
That I'm attending MadisonRuby, SteelCityRuby and DCamp this year.

I finally decided to transition from an anonymous icon on Twitter to a goofy pic of myself.  Doing this is a direct result of making #rubyfriends at the conference.  And when they see me on Twitter, I'd rather that they see my face delivering the pithy witticisms.

I've submitted a conference talk proposal to two venues since returning from RubyMidwest.  I'm also excited about stepping up my programming game and getting more involved in the community.

These are my people :).
