<p>I'll keep it short and sweet but here's the top list of tools that I'm using in various tech areas of my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/clvv/fasd">FASD</a> - Making me more of a speed daemon on cd'ing around terminal along with instant vimming from anywhere. PEW PEW!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> - Speed daemon in graphical environment with starting new programs, running terminal commands, etc.  Akin to Launchy, Gnome-Do, Quicksilver (which I wish worked better on my Mac). [ This one is Mac specific but see other programs for different OSes ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a> - Customizable and nicely integrates with tmux. [Mac specific, but on Linux I've been super happy with Terminator ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> - Terminal multiplexer.  Like screen, but much more easily customized.  Feels like a VIM take on screen control once it's tweaked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> - My favorite editor.  Mainly used in the terminal but occasionally I use MacVim for the glitz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://vimium.github.com/">Vimium</a> - Bring the powers of VIM into the Chrome Browser.  Very very slick interface, especially for opening links, scrolling ... just go install it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/pentie/vimrepress">VimRepress</a> - Blog with Wordpress from the safety confines of VIM (as I am now)... in MARKDOWN!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/">GoogleCl</a> - Commandline access to Google features such as Contacts and Calendars.  Great for adding events from the commandline.  Python tool IIRC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor">QuickCursor</a> - Lets me use VIM to edit just about anything.  It opens a new VIM instance/buffer with the highlighted text, say from an email and pushes it back into that spot after editing w/ Vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.boastr.net/">BetterTouchTool</a> - Nice easy way to assign keystrokes to open a program, move window to specific region of screen, etc.  Also complemented by BetterSnapTool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior">TaskWarrior</a> - Task manager on the commandline.  Like Todo.sh but with more commandline power and no Android/iOS app.  Worthwhile trade at the moment after 3 weeks use.  Does have a Sinatra app with TaskWarrior integration... and I'm tempted to scrape together a Ruby tool to have commandline Pomodoro tracker that integrates with Growl and TaskWarrior (as an annotate function)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And in no specific order:</p>
<p>-Dropbox, Evernote, DashExpander, Pomodairo, TweetDeck, Sparrow/Thunderbird (Sparrow for slick integration, Thunderbird for extensions and power), and last but certainly not least Z-Shell.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments or on Twitter if I'm missing any good tools!</p>
