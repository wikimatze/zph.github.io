    \ I received the nicest email from [LastPass](http://www.lastpass.com) warning
    me that my email address was among the SQL dump posted by the hacker.\r\n\r\n##
    My Response\r\nFirst off, according to ChicagoVPS all the passwords were in the
    form of salted hashes.  So that's good! Also, I use unique passwords thanks to
    LastPass.  So losing one password to a SQL dump in the form of a salted hash isn't
    a big deal.  At least not with ChicagoVPS.  Might be a bigger deal if it was Amazon
    AWS or a Google Account. \r\n\r\n### Back to the Point\r\nI read a wonderful article,
    by chance, about a new service called [Authy](https://www.authy.com/).  Authy
    provides easily integrated Two Factor Authentication services that use your phone
    as the second factor.  Authy either uses a smartphone application or a system
    based on SMS.\r\n\r\n### So where did I add it?\r\n\r\n* [Here](http://blog.xargs.io)
    via the [WP Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/authy-for-wp/)\r\n\r\n*
    [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)\r\n\r\n* [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)\r\n\r\n*
    [Google Account - Gmail](http://gmail.com)\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\nAfter turning
    on Two Factor Authentication with my Google Account, I needed to setup and start
    using 'Application Specific Passwords'.  They're a way to have a unique password
    for specific services that are not setup for the Two Factor Authentication system.\r\n\r\nTo
    find the settings: Log into Gmail > Settings > Account > Security > 2 Step Verification
    Settings > Manage Application Specific Passwords > Login Again > Scroll to Bottom
    of Page.\r\n\r\nFor each item, like Thunderbird, Sparrow App, Android applications,
    etc, you'll need to give the specific password a name.  Next click 'Generate Password'.
    \ Copy that password into your application.\r\n\r\nI must say, I'll be a lot more
    comfortable with online transactions when most service providers (esp. Banks,
    Investment Accounts, Amazon.com, etc) offer Two Factor Login options!\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you've found any other useful places for using Authy's wonderful 2
    Factor Auth through the comments below or on Twitter [@_ZPH](http://www.twitter.com/_zph)."

Follow up... Flashed a new Rom to phone and my only hassle was with Amazon Aws 2 factor Auth.  Make sure to do Authy backup to simplify this before flashing new Roman.
