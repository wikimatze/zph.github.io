    of the self.  The discussions started at RubyMidwest but since I don't yet have
    their permission, I'll leave the individual as a shadowy anonymous figure.\r\n\r\nThe
    evening of the discussion brought about a conversation regarding refactoring oneself
    through a constant process of testing and revising.\r\n\r\nI shared my own experience
    of setting actionable goals related to various facets of my life, a choice that
    was influence by _7 Habits of Highly Effective People_.  These goals run the gamut
    of goals, anywhere from family, friendship, business, personal knowledge, technical
    skill acquisition, etc.  Each of the goals is categorized and provides a broadly
    sketched roadmap of what I want to apply my energy to during 2013.\r\n\r\nWithout
    going into all of the details, I'd like to provide a couple of examples.\r\n\r\nOne
    of my larger goals for the year is to be less of a consumer and more of a producer.
    \ This applies both in the technical world, where I want to write more code and
    blog entries (rather than simply consuming them) and also in my online social
    experience where I'm moving out of my introverted shell and making connections
    with likeminded individuals.  Thus far, this goal has been a smashing success.
    \ I made new Ruby friends at RubyMidwest and I'm a much more active member of
    the online community.  I'm pleasantly surprised that this is such a natural goal
    to work on.  It has become an outlet of my energy that's relaxing and fulfilling.\r\n\r\nIn
    this same vein, I've become increasingly interested in giving back and contributing
    via teaching or volunteering in order to help others along their path.  _Pragmatic
    Thinking and Learning_ cites the Dreyfus Model of Learning, which loosely paraphrased,
    indicates that because I'm a beginning intermediate programmer, I'm uniquely prepared
    to lend a hand to beginners.  The fact that I've been teaching myself Ruby for
    the past 3 years means that beginners' struggles are fresh in my mind.  So I'm
    taking what time I can out of my schedule to lend a hand to the next generation
    of passionate programmers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the not too distant future, I'll
    have a work setup that encourages and allows me to spend a portion of my time
    giving back to the community.  The time's approaching where I won't be able to
    resist the allure of professionally joining the ranks of software developers.\r\n\r\nIf
    I may breach the fourth wall, what are your goals and aspirations gentle reader?
    I'd love to hear about them in the comments or in the walled garden of Twitter
    [@_ZPH](http://twitter.com/_ZPH)."
