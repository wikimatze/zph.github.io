    While looking for a zsh compatible way to replace AutoJump with a ZSH compatible option, I found the following:
    [cc_bash]setopt autocd
    setopt AUTO_PUSHD[/cc_bash]
    The first option allow moving into a new directory by directly typing it's name without 'cd DIRECTORY'.

    The second option allows easier navigation using 'dirs -v' to check for recent directories or cd ~+<TAB> for tab completion jumping :).

    Another little way to save small repetitions!

    As a side note: I'm quite sad not to have the flexibility of AutoJump in my repetoire with ZSH.  It's the only feature I find lacking compared to BASH.  Hopefully it works better in ZSH in the near future, or hopefully I can look into why it doesn't work and learn how to patch it.
