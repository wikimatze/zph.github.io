<p>Dear Parallels Team,</p>
<p>It's unacceptable to put ads in a product for which I paid full price (ie Parallels Desktop 7).</p>
<p>Thanks to Google and someone in the Parallels forum for mentioning that the answer is here:
  <a href="http://netizensmith.org.uk/wp/?p=76">NetizenSmith.org.uk</a>.  This is a much more palattable place to learn about it compared to needing a Private Message on the Parallels Forum.</p>
<p>Credit to Netizen for finding out that you can type the following in the terminal to remove their ads:
  [cc]defaults write com.parallels.Parallels Desktop ProductPromo.ForcePromoOff -bool YES[/cc]</p><!-- #VIMREPRESS_TAG# http://blog.xargs.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimrepress_4fe8cf44_mkd.odt vimrepress_4fe8cf44_mkd.odt -->
