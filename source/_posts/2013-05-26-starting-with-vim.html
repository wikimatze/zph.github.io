  mkd_text: "It's been two lovely years with Vim and I'm **sold**!  Vim's the straight
    edge razor that slices through code.  It's like having a finely crafted and personalized
    lightsaber.\r\n\r\nThis post is aimed at getting a new Vim user up to speed without
    cutting off or wanting to sever their hands.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n*
    Use GVim or MacVim (avoid Terminal Vim until more proficient, then generally avoid
    GUI Vims)\r\n* Learn the Vim Modes\r\n* Learn survival tactics ala [Progressive
    Vim](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)\r\n* Learn
    to serenade this wild beast called Vim in its own language\r\n* Add plugins\r\n\r\nI'll
    assume that readers of my blog can install GVim or MacVim on their own.  On OSX
    it's as simple as using homebrew.  On Linux, use the awesome package manager of
    your choice.\r\n\r\n## Vim Modes\r\n\r\nVim is a modal editor.  You have three
    essential modes of operating:\r\n\r\n* Insert Mode (used for typing)\r\n* Visual
    Mode (used for selecting)\r\n* Command Mode (used for executing commands/movements)\r\n\r\nHaving
    three modes means that the keyboard can have 3x the number of functions because
    each key can have an alternate meaning in the various modes.  For example, take
    the letter 'i':\r\n\r\n* In command mode, i places the user in insert mode\r\n*
    In insert mode, i types the letter i\r\n* in visual mode, it appears not to do
    anything (I could be wrong, but 10 secs of testing back me up)\r\n\r\nThe first
    thing to learn is a lesson from Douglas Adams: \"Don't Panic!\".\r\n\r\nWhen lost
    in Vim or things are going wrong, mash ESC until you're back in Command Mode.\r\n\r\nWhen
    a file gets messed up because you're unfamiliar with Vim, type ESC followed by
    :q! This will quit the file without saving changes (forced quit).  If the changes
    are important, enter command mode with ESC and type :wq to write the changes to
    disk.\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to type into the text file, type i to enter insert
    mode.  At this point, typing will proceed as normal until you hit escape to leave
    insert mode.\r\n\r\n## Pat yourself on the back\r\nYou're now as accomplished
    as I was for my first year of dabbling with Vim!\r\n\r\nI didn't realize how little
    of Vim I knew until I saw the surgeon's precision with which Gary Bernhardt wielded
    Vim.  As soon as I saw this I wanted more.\r\n\r\nI took his advice and started
    paying attention to the language of Vim, which largely consists of unmodified
    alphabet keys and shifted alphabet keys.  Learning some of these has made my typing
    DRASTICALLY more efficient.  I now feel very little resistance when typing.  It's
    as if my thoughts are able to leap onto the screen without obstacles.  It's magic
    folks!  And you too can cast these spells with enough time and effort.\r\n\r\nBut
    mastering Vim (or at least becoming proficient) is a longer topic than I can cover
    in this post.  So let's move on to discuss plugins and the .vimrc.\r\n\r\n## Vimrc\r\nLet's
    get this out of the way: Vim's not terribly friendly with the default configuration!\r\n\r\nSo
    what's the solution? .vimrc and Vim plugins.\r\n\r\nThe .vimrc file goes in your
    home directory, ie ~/.vimrc, and dictates Vim's configuration.  You can tweak
    the colorscheme, the timeoutlen, and just about anything from here.  Here's an
    example of what's in my own .vimrc:\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/db3c4ad77f7a9d27fcaa.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nPlugins
    are re-usable Vim code that has grown too large to be included in the Vimrc.  Plugins
    extend the functionality of Vim and can make it act more like an IDE.  There's
    currently a vibrant community of Vim users and a growing number of Vim plugins.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a list of My Current Plugins [repo](https://github.com/zph/zph/tree/master/home/.vim/bundle):\r\n\r\nAnd
    here are the ones that I use daily:\r\n\r\n[cc_bash]\r\nack.vim\r\nctrlp.vim\r\ndelimitMate\r\ngundo\r\nslimux\r\nsupertab\r\nsweet-rspec-vim\r\nvim-bundler\r\nvim-commentary\r\nvim-detailed\r\nvim-dispatch\r\nvim-endwise\r\nvim-eunuch\r\nvim-fugitive\r\nvim-git\r\nvim-numbertoggle\r\nvim-powerline\r\nvim-rails\r\nvim-repeat\r\nvim-rspec\r\nvim-ruby\r\nvim-ruby-refactoring\r\nvim-surround\r\n[/cc_bash]\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps get someone started in Vim.  It's a very rewarding and sometimes frustrating
    journey.\r\n\r\nI'd love to help my readers learn Vim! Let me know about your
