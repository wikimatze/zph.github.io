I've been working on my VIM configurations recently which involved cleaning out cruft from when I hadn't transitioned to using Pathogen. While doing so I realized that I wanted to take the advice of [DestroyAllSoftware.com](www.DestroyAllSoftware.com) and switch away from Nerdtree to something that doesn't involve a context switch.  CtrlP to the rescue! Slick addon that I'm happy to have in my arsenal.
Plus, it didn't necessitate installing and configuring VIM with Ruby 1.8.7 as Command-T did :).
