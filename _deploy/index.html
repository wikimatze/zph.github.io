  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers, we&rsquo;re familiar with the basic software tools that grease the wheels of the programming world.  Version control systems, deployment tools, notification hooks, CI servers: they all make our jobs easier.</p>

<p>But how can we work better as an organization when our startup exceeds 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 software developers?</p>

<p>There are three essential tools/behaviors that need to be implemented for a software company to be successful.</p>

<ol>
<li>Project Management Software</li>
<li>Git workflows and commit message standards</li>
<li>Cultivating your Developers&#8217; creativity</li>
</ol>


<h2>Project Management Software</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you hate long running email threads that attempt to pin down the acceptance criteria and context of projects or stories. Instead of pinning down anything, they drag on from one day to the next, to everyones&#8217; chagrin.</p>

<p>Pull the email escape hatch and move into the 21st century!</p>

<p>A good start is having a unified interface for tasks, ie a Project Tracker.  This gives the technical and non-technical folks a single point of interface for all the knowledge of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening&rdquo; and &ldquo;what timelines are we operating under?&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s incredibly important that the software is convenient to use &amp; updated in realtime.</p>

<p>Though I don&rsquo;t get any referral bonuses, my favorite thus far is Pivotal Tracker and if you&rsquo;re an Emacs user check out <a href="https://github.com/jxa/pivotal-tracker">Pivotal-Tracker-mode</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/zph/pivotal-tracker">fork</a> of that project. I prefer using the Emacs interface rather than their web interface when working in a large organization because it&rsquo;s faster.</p>

<p>So now you have a single channel of communication and record keeping system for projects, YAY!  Rambling email threads will (mostly) fade into your company&rsquo;s past!</p>

<h2>Git workflows and commit message standards</h2>

<p>Next, come up with a style guide for Git commits and version control practices.  Maybe you use &lsquo;git-flow&rsquo;.  Maybe you come up with your own variant of an established workflow.  But discuss it among the engaged members on the team.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend running all code changes through other members on the team. A spare pair of eyes is invaluable as is the unique context/domain knowledge that a team-member brings to the table.  If you&rsquo;re using a web based interface for Git such as Github, consider using &ldquo;Pull Requests&rdquo;.  They&rsquo;ve become a standard practice in the Github using community.  If you have a team using an alternate git-based solution, consider submitting all code as patches through the Dev Leads.  Doing so will catch some issues before they make it into production.</p>

<p>As for git commit messages, educate your developers on why they&rsquo;re important.</p>

<p>Take the following commits:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Fixed thing that was wrong</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[ZPH/KM][#3489634] Updated Jquery selector for dashboard login box
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Dashboard login box functionality was broken (SHA a98adf91) due to a change in `dashboard.slim`.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Changed selector to $('.login_box') to match slim file.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Can you imagine which is easier to reference 6 months in the future?  Say, when you&rsquo;re investigating why the dashboard login is broken? Or maybe you&rsquo;re a Dev lead looking for the commits related to a specific project story.  If you&rsquo;re on a team where stories are completed in pairs, it&rsquo;s a good idea to include the initials of both parties who worked on the commits.  Then it&rsquo;s simple to answer the question of: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Zander and Kerri do something with our dashboard last week?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you have developers writing descriptive commits, finding answers to questions is as easy as <code>git log -S dashboard</code> for a list of each commit involving the word dashboard.</p>

<h2>Care and Feeding of Developers</h2>

<p>Last and certainly not least is related to the care and feeding of software developers.  We might not all be beautiful and unique snowflakes (we in the Ruby community do largely use Apple computers after all) but we require regular care to stay sharp and engaged.</p>

<h3>10% Time</h3>

<p>Set aside dedicated time to have developers work on more creative projects.  Why bother?</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers are valuable and losing them is expensive.</li>
<li>Happy programmers are productive programmers.</li>
<li>Who else could be better situated to see inherent flaws in existing software/tools/workflows in the organization? Let them scratch their own itch.</li>
<li>Doing the same tasks day in and day out is a sure-fire recipe for dulling even the brightest minds.  So knock it off!</li>
</ul>


<p>Build in time each two weeks that&rsquo;s dedicated to creative projects envisioned by the coders.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;m currently working, we do this every 10th business day and it&rsquo;s called our 10% time.  On those days, we come up with interesting projects that advance the company&rsquo;s interests without the same pressure of failure.  These are great times to implement something in a new technology or setup those Git hook integrations with Pivotal Tracker. Fix things that are slowing you down or bothering you on a regular basis.  What else could you work on?</p>

<ul>
<li>An idempotent way to setup new developer workstations (script based please).</li>
<li>A unified script for firing up the application stack on a local machine (or stopping, reloading, updating, etc).</li>
<li>Team chat integrations like Campfire + Hubot, HipChat + Github Merge notification.</li>
<li>Dashboard for your income generating parts of software. Track those leads in realtime!</li>
<li>Build tools to simplify your Quality Assurance teams&#8217; lives. Or build tools so Product can be more efficient.</li>
</ul>


<p>10% is the perfect time for fixing these nagging issues. The only requirement is that the developers generate most of the 10% ideas and get to vote with their feet (or digital feet) in choosing what tasks to work on.  They&rsquo;ll self organize into teams where they can be most efficient. Cultivate your developers and they&rsquo;ll flourish!  Also, you won&rsquo;t have to engage recruiters because your retention will go through the roof. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>PS &ndash; I have a new friend from @RbOnAles with experience in automated QA and some Ruby programming who is looking for his next adventure, either in SF or remote.  DM me on Twitter to find out more information.</p>

<p>Thoughts, comments or jeers are all encouraged! Come have chat w/ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_zph">@_ZPH</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know the secret about tech conferences? It&rsquo;s not about the talks.  It&rsquo;s not about the venue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about all the people who are there!</p>

<p>While attending <a href="https://twitter.com/rbonales">@RbOnAles</a>, I was asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/eliserius"> @eliserius </a> about how I knew so many people there.  This article is a summary of that discussion.</p>

<p>First off, go to a couple conferences each year.  It&rsquo;s best if your employer will pay all or part of the way.  But if they won&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to make it to the conferences.  They&rsquo;re an investment in your career&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re attending 3+ regional tech conferences each year, what steps can you take to make the most of it?  Well, remember that you&rsquo;re attending to meet the other attendees.  By virtue of them also attending the conference, they either work at decent companies or they prioritize conference attendance.</p>

<p>So meet these folks!  It&rsquo;s not hard*. (It&rsquo;s terrifying at first, but push past that &amp; make it happen).  I&rsquo;m an introverted person and know a fair number of Ruby conference attendees, but those first few minutes of awkwardly interacting are just that: uncomfortable.  That&rsquo;s fine, move the conversation into tech stuff.  Chat about Service Oriented Architecture, argue about Dependency Injection, take a stand and say that Ruby isn&rsquo;t a dying language.</p>

<p>Remember, these folks who are at the conference also want to meet people.</p>

<p>What specific steps do I recommend for breaking the ice or stacking your social deck at the conference?</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t attend conferences with workmates.  Or if you&rsquo;re at conference, avoid them.  There are 363 other days to bs with &lsquo;em.  You&rsquo;ve only got 24 hrs * 3 days for the conference&hellip; make the most of it and meet new people.</li>
<li>Set a goal of meeting X new people at conference. Let&rsquo;s consider &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; to be defined as exchanging names and at least one memorable detail about the other party. Maybe they juggle, write assembly, breed horses.  Folks all have a story, ask &ldquo;What brought you to the conference&rdquo;.  Or &ldquo;What tech stuff are you playing with right now?&rdquo;. Or start a heated debate about which <code>$EDITOR</code> to use.  If you&rsquo;re stumped about approaching someone, just be candid, &ldquo;I saw you standing there &amp; realized we hadn&rsquo;t met yet: I&rsquo;m Zander&rdquo;.  Most of the time that&rsquo;s enough to kick off a conversation, though you might choose to use your own name in the prior quotation.</li>
<li>Take your meals with a different new group each time.  With a 2 day conference, that gives you 4 opportunities to meet groups of 4+ people each time.  Some conferences actively organize this kind of activity.  Big shoutout to <a href="http://twitter.com/steelcityruby">@steelcityruby</a> for doing this stuff :).  If your conference isn&rsquo;t doing this, post on twitter that you&rsquo;re organizing a group for Italian/Thai/Indian/Bar food and see who bites.</li>
<li>While out having food with others, buy a meal or drink for some folks you don&rsquo;t know well.  Do it for the nice factor the icing on the cake is that you&rsquo;ll seem even more awesome than you already are.</li>
<li>Bring something to share to the conference and then offer it up to people.  Could be a cardgame, boardgame, bourbon, soda water, LAN party&hellip; just get yourself out there.</li>
<li>Volunteer to carpool from airport to conference.  Or from major city to tiny town where conference exists.</li>
<li>Learn 2 love Twitter.  Start or revive your account.  Twitter is the lifeblood of many Ruby conferences.  Start up Tweetdeck or Tweetbot and add a column dedicated to the conference hashtag.  That way you&rsquo;ll be aware of the pulse of things.</li>
<li>Post Twitter messages with hashtag.  For example at this last conference, I had the pleasure of doing breakfast with my favorite Aussie (<a href="http://twitter.com/ryanbigg">@ryanbigg</a>) by virtue of an early morning Tweet about meeting for breakfast.  It&rsquo;ll also force you to meet people who you might not otherwise get to meet.</li>
<li>Stay at the conference hotel &amp; possibly split a room w/ someone you don&rsquo;t know.  Put a call out among friends to find someone to split room.  It&rsquo;ll be awesome.  At least it has been for me thus far.  Staying at conference hotel itself is wonderful because you&rsquo;ll be in the middle of the action, late night philosophizing on OOP vs. Functional, etc.</li>
<li>Stick around for the evening events each day.  Also stay for the workshops that often take place after the conference ends.  At Ruby On Ales, it was a MiniTest workshop by <a href="http://twitter.com/blowmage">@blowmage</a>.  It was awesome and I got to meet a few more people before leaving.</li>
<li>Still stumped for how to approach people at conference? See if you can recognize anyone at conference from Twitter or Github profiles.  Then go up &amp; thank them for the Open Source work they do.  It&rsquo;ll give them chills :). (This advice brought to you by <a href="http://twitter.com/sarahmei">@sarahmei</a> who you should say hi to when you see her at a conference).</li>
<li>Be a speaker: you literally have to talk to people.  At end of talk, invite them to stop you and chat, because you&rsquo;re shy and want to meet people.  Ask for help, it&rsquo;s cool :).</li>
<li>Final tip: I&rsquo;m terrified at the beginning of each conversation.  Once I warm up, it&rsquo;s groovy, but until then it&rsquo;s rough.  Get that momentum going, force yourself out of the comfort zone, and see what happens.  Soon enough, those conferences will feel like reunions filled with friends.</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, I&rsquo;m terrified of starting conversations&hellip; so be my guest and come up &amp; tell me you read this post.  That&rsquo;ll break the ice!</p>

<p>PS &ndash; I have a new friend from @RbOnAles who&rsquo;s looking for a remote role (or in SF) either as QA or Jr. Ruby Developer. DM me on Twitter if you know of options.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the weekend I finally admitted to myself that I hate submodules.</p>

<p>But they&rsquo;re a keystone to one of my primary development tools: Vim.  In order to use Vim, I use the Pathogen.vim plugin by @tpope.  In order to use Pathogen, you normally use submodules in the <code>.vim/bundle/</code> folder.</p>

<p>But submodules are the work of the devil.</p>

<p>I tried out the Vundle plugin and was seeing much longer loadtime for vim:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/db5aa2dc128693ba9583.js"></script>


<p>So I asked around on Twitter and <a href="https://twitter.com/jwieringa"> @jwieringa </a> advised me to checkout <a href="https://github.com/csexton/infect"> &lsquo;infect&rsquo; </a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/crsexton"> @crsexton </a>.</p>

<p>And <code>infect</code> is awesome! It works with Pathogen to give it a declarative style for plugins.  An example is:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Use it. Love it. Don&rsquo;t look back!</p>

<p>If you want faster downloads with &lsquo;infect&rsquo; try this unofficial fork of the standalone: <a href="https://github.com/zph/zph/blob/master/home/bin/infect.">https://github.com/zph/zph/blob/master/home/bin/infect.</a>  When I have time, I&rsquo;ll work w/ @crsexton to get this added to &lsquo;infect&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The ca-certificates weren&rsquo;t up to date according to the install script.</p>

<p>Really, the ca-certificates weren&rsquo;t in the right location for RVM&rsquo;s curl install script.</p>

<p>These commands as root fixed it:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blame smartOS not reading my SATA controller.</p>

<p>Blame Linux for not having first class support for ZFS (where my data is held).</p>

<p>Blame <a href="https://twitter.com/canadiancreed"> @canadiancreed </a> for giving me a way out of the quandry.</p>

<p>The backstory is that I moved all of my backups to two ZFS pools a few years ago.  I was running ZFSonLinux and it generally worked&hellip;. except when I rebooted the server and had to force import the pools.</p>

<p>Fast forward to that server being replaced by a workstation (i7 Haswell, 240GB Sata3 SSD, and 24GB RAM).  I tried smartOS by Joyent and ran into issues with my SATA controller not being recognized.  It&rsquo;s a shame given how awesome the smartOS vm administration is.  I mean vmadm and imgadm are light years ahead of Docker.</p>

<p>Since smartOS refused to recognize 3 of my 8 drives I ran back to Linux.  The good new, Linux recognized the sata controller.  The bad news, Linux couldn&rsquo;t import the pools.  Frankly, Linux had a hell of a time with building the ZFS on Linux kernel modules.  I managed to piece together a few clues from the ZFSonLinux Issues on Github.  In fact, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dajhorn"> @dajhorn </a> for supplying answers on that Github issue which allowed me to build the kernel modules.</p>

<p>This sounds promising doesn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s not, it was a horrorshow.  Linux refused to import the one of the two zpools.  One of them imported nicely, the mission critical financial records.  The other semi-critical zpool was shot and refused to import under Linux.</p>

<p>I spent a whole evening banging my head against this issue. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for <a href="https://twitter.com/canadiancreed"> Chris Reed </a> I wouldn&rsquo;t have hit upon the solution.</p>

<p>His recommendation was to try FreeBSD&hellip; so I did.  And it recognized the SATA controller and also imported the zpools cleanly!  So after a dry run w/ FreeBSD, I installed PC-BSD, which is a desktop variant based on FreeBSD. Think of it as the Ubuntu of the BSD world.  And hell yeah, it&rsquo;s all working :).</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m really liking it.  Replace &lsquo;aptitude&rsquo; with &lsquo;pkg&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s pretty similar.  Except, PC-BSD is working where Linux &amp; ZFS were a hassle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into an issue with using <code>xargs</code> with <code>rm -rf</code>.</p>

<p>This could be dicey, so get your safety hats on.</p>

<p>The issue was that the filename included an apostrophe.  So when trying to do a simple command such as <code>tree -fi | grep conflicted | xargs rm -f '{}'</code>, I received an error about having an unterminated quote in the parameter.</p>

<p>Apparently, some versions of xargs allow you to specify a delimiter with a <code>-d</code> but the copy on my Mac didn&rsquo;t have such a flag.</p>

<p>Instead, I learned that <code>egrep --null</code> will use a null character as the divider between matches.  So the following solved my problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>tree -fi | egrep --null conflicted | xargs -0 rm -f <span class="s1">&#39;{}&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s break that command set down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tree -fi</code> is a trick I recently learned from my friend @olleolleolle.  It prints out the local tree of files and the -fi prints out the whole filename (including directories).</li>
<li><code>egrep --null conflicted</code> is where the magic starts.  The <code>--null</code> flag tell egrep to separate matches with a null character.</li>
<li><code>xargs -0 rm -f '{}'</code> this tells xargs that the null character is divider and to remove each filename that comes through the linux pipe.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is yet another example of why I&rsquo;m impressed with the commandline.  Simple little tools that can be chained together with symbiotic behavior.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday was the kind of day where I dropped into a Pry repl in order to bang out an automation script.</p>

<p>The challenge was: automate the retrival of specific emails that contained receipts, wrangle them into sane data structures, and dump them into a spreadsheet with both daily totals and an absolute total.</p>

<p>An example email looked like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'> Thank you for visiting http://www.example.com  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First step was to build an email parser for this format.  I tried to keep it tolerant of future changes to the email generation scheme.</p>

<p>The general steps involved are:
1. Split the body linewise
2. Create a method for each piece of content to extract.
3. From the collection of lines, grep for the line with appropriate unique text.
4. Then in that line, use a regex to find the specific portion of data.</p>

<p>The full code for that module is listed below.</p>

<p>With that in order, I set about using the awesome <code>ruby-gmail</code> gem for retrieving said emails. Note: after completing this project, I learned of a continuation of the <code>ruby-gmail</code> gem called <code>gmail</code>.  All the code in these examples is specific to the older incarnation of the gem.</p>

<p><code>ruby-gmail</code> has a simple interface for retrieving messages between date ranges.  So I setup a specific Gmail filter for emails from a certain sender that included the text &lsquo;receipt&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing too fancy in this code, but it&rsquo;s important to set <code>@gmail.peek = true</code> so that programatically viewed emails aren&rsquo;t marked &lsquo;read&rsquo;.  Also of note is the use of Dotenv for setting secret values without risking them in a git repo.</p>

<p>The last task in building this tool was dumping the data to a CSV with totals by date as well as a grand total. The process is simple, pass in a collection of messages and iterate through them by date, add a subtotal per date, then add a final row with grand total.</p>

<p>I like to break out rows into their own methods when possible.  In fact, were I to rewrite this code, the message row would have its own method to clean up the inner loop of <code>messages_by_date()</code>.  Another trick that helped for testing was to not generate a file on the filesystem.  <code>CSV</code> takes either an <code>open</code> or a <code>generate</code> method.  With <code>generate</code> it will pass the complete csv file out as the return value!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also quite proud of the variable name <code>rawsum</code> because it&rsquo;s rawsome to design code that will save a couple hours every two weeks.</p>

<p>With a good ecosystem of libraries, it&rsquo;s only a couple hours of work to write a re-usable tool that saves significant amounts of time. Hooray :).</p>

<time datetime="2013-06-20T00:42:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 20<span>th</span>, 2013</time> -

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started off as a casual inquiry on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/geopet">@geopet</a> Sounds strange that 193 would work for external API and not 2.0.. can you share what you’re working on? Or TDD test via webmock?</p>&mdash; Zander (@_ZPH) <a href="https://twitter.com/_ZPH/statuses/345536278604963841">June 14, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And led to my friend @geopet posting the Minimum Viable Demo as a Gist:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Strabd">@Strabd</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/_ZPH">@_ZPH</a> But here’s the gist with the code and the results: <a href="https://t.co/ajiAh8lQTN">https://t.co/ajiAh8lQTN</a></p>&mdash; Geoff Petrie (@geopet) <a href="https://twitter.com/geopet/statuses/345567430841597952">June 14, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<h2>And it was interesting</h2>

<p>What we found out was that the Ruby open-uri library would make calls to an external API (Wunderground) and throw a Zlib::DataError when run in MRI Ruby 2.0.0.  The strange thing was that MRI 1.9.3 works perfectly fine.  Same exact story when the GET Request comes from Net/HTTP instead of open-uri.  But it succeeds on 2.0.0 when using the RestClient Gem, as documented by @injekt.</p>

<h2>The Gloves Come Off</h2>

<p>We dove into the source of the error and determined that it was thrown from <code>net/http/response.rb:357</code>.  In order to better understand the error, I sequentially placed <code>binding.pry</code> statements to determine where the error percolated to the surface.  It was the call to <code>@inflate.finish</code> which was where the Zlib::DataError surfaced.</p>

<p>I left the code at this point and posted my initial findings back to Geoff and left the project alone.</p>

<h2>Today</h2>

<p>Then I saw this message and it was time for more digging :).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_ZPH">@_ZPH</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_jarvis">@lee_jarvis</a> for helping out with my 1.9.3/2.0 question. The discussion has led to more questions, but it’s a start!</p>&mdash; Geoff Petrie (@geopet) <a href="https://twitter.com/geopet/statuses/347460923130269696">June 19, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I started by forking his Gist and pulling it down to my local computer. My first phase of troubleshooting was to try alternate tools, in order to see how they dump the HTTP response.  Good ol&#8217; <code>curl</code> came to the rescue and provided me with the results that I placed in <a href="https://github.com/zph/mri_2_0_0_zlib_troubleshooting/blob/master/curl_response.txt">curl_response.txt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zph/mri_2_0_0_zlib_troubleshooting/blob/master/curl_raw.txt">curl_raw.txt</a>.  Notice the rather interesting artifact around line 12 on the RAW version that isn&rsquo;t present in the alternate curl response.</p>

<h2>Pulling in Net/HTTP</h2>

<p>It felt like progress and I wanted a better way to tweak the net/http library.  I prepended the local directory to Ruby&rsquo;s LOAD_PATH and copies the net folder out from MRI&rsquo;s lib directory.  Having the <code>Dir.pwd</code> prepended to the path enabled me to make very convenient testing tweaks to the Ruby Standard Library without needing to alter my standard RVM install :).</p>

<h2>Tapping the Sockets</h2>

<p>With net/http libs loaded from the local file, I was off to the races. I tapped into the internal workings by using the &lsquo;sack&rsquo; utility <a href="https://github.com/zph/sack">sack</a> for jumping directly into and editing <code>ack</code> results.  With the addition of a strategically placed <code>binding.pry</code>, I was able to tap into the live socket info via a <code>socket.read_all</code> and write that out as a binary dump to <code>socket_content.bin</code>.</p>

<h2>Reducing it to Elements</h2>

<p>The last step in my troubleshooting was to create <code>zlib_targeted.rb</code> for isolating the zlib load issues from net/http.  Since the underlying issue appears to be a malformed gzip returned from Wunderground&rsquo;s API, I created zlib_targeted.rb to remove net/http from the equation.  Check out the demo content of the file below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/a7bfc0acbc0876363ede.js"></script>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now we have a very narrowly tailored set of examples that dig into the exact errors, thanks to @geopet, myself, and @injekt.</p>

<p>For more info, see the comments in this Gist repo from @geopet:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/geopet/5782836">Initial Gist</a></p>

<p>Or my repo that includes the files described in this post:
<a href="https://github.com/zph/mri_2_0_0_zlib_troubleshooting">Full repo</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with how the toubleshooting has progressed and would like to see this issue resolved, whether it is a malformed response from Wunderground, intolerant behavior from MRI 2.0.0, or anything else.</p>

<time datetime="2013-06-02T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 2<span>nd</span>, 2013</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pair Programming is becoming a big deal in the Ruby programming world: this guide will help you get started.</p>




<h2>Pre-Reqs:</h2>




<p>General familiarity with Ruby tools (Bundler, Gems, RVM/Rbenv)
Basic commandline comfort</p>




<h2>What is Pairing?</h2>




<p>In its simplest form, pair programming is where a pair of programmers work on a problem using the same computer.</p>




<p>Since I live don&#8217;t live in a technology hub in America, programming in the same physical location is challenging.  Instead, it&#8217;s possible to replicate that experience with both parties in separate locations.</p>




<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>




<p>Setup a video call using Skype, Google Plus, Twelephone.
Both partners connect into a shared machine such as a Virtual Private Server (VPS).
Each partner connects into a shared Tmux session.
Both of the individuals can jointly edit the same files, as if they were present at the same keyboard.</p>




<h2>Setting It Up From Scratch</h2>




<p>Signup with a VPS provider (I&#8217;m currently very happy with <a href="www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>)
Boot up a basic 512MB RAM instance in the Linux flavor of your choice. I&#8217;ll use Ubuntu 12.04 x32 for this example.
Once the instance is booted up, let&#8217;s connect and setup basic sane defaults.
Install tmux and vim-nox using the package manager.
Install Ruby using RVM, Rbenv, or Chruby.
Install Tweemux Gem - <code>gem install tweemux</code>
Now that we&#8217;ve laid the groundwork for it, let&#8217;s work on making it available for a partner.</p>




<h2>Inviting a Pair</h2>




<p>When ready to invite a pairing partner, we start by adding a unique user for them.  For convenience, it&#8217;s best to add their username from Github.</p>




<p><code>adduser --disabled-password $PAIRNAME</code></p>




<p>Next we&#8217;ll use the Tweemux Gem from RKing to pull down the partner&#8217;s public key from Github, and add it to their <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</p>




<p><code>tweemux hubkey $PAIRNAME</code></p>




<p>At this point in the process, that user can login to your server using the IP address, their Github username, and their matching private key.</p>




<p>ie - <code>ssh $PAIRNAME@IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER</code></p>




<p>At this point, the host should fire up a shared Tmux session:</p>




<p><code>tmux -S /tmp/pair</code></p>




<p>And enable that socket to be world readable:</p>




<p><code>chmod 777 /tmp/pair</code></p>




<p>NOTE: Doing this on anything other than a bare server, or with someone you don&#8217;t trust, isn&#8217;t a secure or a good idea.  Don&#8217;t do this on a production server or with sketchy folks!</p>




<p>Next, it&#8217;s time for the guest to join the shared Tmux session:</p>




<p><code>tmux -S /tmp/pair attach</code></p>




<p>And you&#8217;re both in the same Tmux session!  The view, keyboard and such is all shared =).</p>
